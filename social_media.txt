Social media are interactive media technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information,
ideas, interests, and other forms of expression through virtual communities and networks.[1][2] While 
challenges to the definition of social media arise[3][4] due to the variety of stand-alone and built-in  
social media services currently available.
