Users usually access social media services through web-based apps on desktops or download services that offer 
social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these 
electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms which individuals, communities, and organizations 
can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated or self-curated content posted online.
Additionally, social media are used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself, 
and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites.
